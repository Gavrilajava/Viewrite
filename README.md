# ViewWrite - Small chat app

Small chat application designed to master technologies such as web socket tapescript and redux. Hardly makes sense to watch it at work, so I didn't do the demo. However, you can install it yourself and enjoy its magnificent design.

* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Backend framework
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Library used to build front-end
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - State management library

## To get started
* intall [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

* while you in here, run **npm run dev** to start backend server in development mode
* go to **client** and run **npm install** to update packages
* in the same folder run **npm start** to run the react server.
